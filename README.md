# kuka_kickass_kalman
Localize omnidirectional robot in Gazebo 

# Getting Started
[Install](http://www.youbot-store.com/wiki/index.php/Gazebo_simulation) KUKA model robot, and robot drivers. 

# Starting project from launch file
Assumes youbot came from http://github.com/youbot/youbot_simulation.git and http://github.com/youbot/youbot_description.git. 
Make sure these projects are sourced so ROS can find them.
After running catkin_make in workspace, you can use launch file 
to generate an empty world with the YouBot robot initialized to position (0,0,0). It also starts the sensor_model node, kf_node, and the Move_You node. These are the nodes for the sensor model, Kalman filter localization, and teleoperation drivers

-----------------------------------
### Robot Driver
Provided by youbot_driver

### Localization
Publishes the bot position given command velocity and sensor data. Also used to publish the error between localization position and the bot's true position.

### Sensor Driver
Assumes position variables x and y are independent of each other, and that their covariance is 0 between them. Applies Gaussian noise to the ground truth position. Assumes a standard deviation of 0.2 for the Gaussian noise for both x and y.

### Teleop Driver
Receives inputs from keyboard and converts them into command velocities which drive the bot at 1 m/s forwards (N), backwards (S), left(E) and right(W).

## To run youbot and teleop (Move_You)
1) run ```$ catkin_make install``` inside of the ```catkin_ws``` workspace
2) Inside your ```catkin_ws``` run ```$ source devel/setup.bash```
3) run ```$ roscore```
4) in a new terminal run: ```$ roslaunch youbot_gazebo_robot youbot_base_only.launch``` 
5) Wait for Gazebo to build world and stage bot
6) In another terminal run ```$ rosrun kuka_kickass_kalman Move_You.py``` 
7) You can now type commands, either N, S, E, or W to move the youbot 1 meter in the prescribed direction

## To start all project nodes: Move_You, kf_node, and sensor_model
run ```$ roslaunch kuka_kickass_kalman youbot_kalman.launch```

## Custom Messages
To observe localization odom run ```rostopic echo geometry_msgs/Pos/xEst```
To observe error in odom run ```rostopic echo geometry_msgs/Pos/error```

## Plots
to plot odometry uncomment ```kf.graph()``` in ```kf_node.py```

The blue line is true trajectory, the black line is dead reckoning trajectory,

the green point is positioning observation

The red circle is estimated covariance in EKF
